Compare apples with apples with the help of Computer Vision

In /notebooks the complete project can be found in the several steps:

data pipeline:
0_Pre_processing_steps.ipynb contains the transformations of images to Tensors directly and to numpy and then to Tensors.

build pipeline:
1_CNN_classifier contains the team model based on a CNN followed by a classifier with 4 classes (fully connected linear network with a softmax).

1_Resnet_classifier contains the resnet model followed by a classifier with 4 classes.

run pipeline:
23_AQL_statistics are succeeded by 
234_AQL_statistics_chatbot 
and 
2345_AQL_statistics_chatbot_interface

In /models the saved models can be found
